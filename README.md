# Coding questions tracker

This is Thuc's record of solving coding interview questions

## My goal is 300+ problems at the end of October 2021 (FAILED SUCCESSFULLY)
### Problems solved: 143

# Some thoughts:
- At new grad level, most of company don't look leetcode maxis, they look for engnineer with good problem solving skill. I didn't see this until I pass Google technical interview with 100's problems.
- I didn't learn to type out solutions of a 100 questions, I learned how to come up with multiple solutions. Exploring, analysing, evaluating your ideas, your designs are what they're looking for.
